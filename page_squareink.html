                <h5>Layouts</h5>
                <p>&middot; Designed
                    <b>Circuit Board</b> as the main page layout with animations</p>
                <p>&middot; Adopted
                    <b>Wintendo Switch</b> as the project page style with buttons and images</p>
                <!-- <p>&middot; Defined
                    <b>Custom Layout</b> to include the game view and a return button, a hint button, and a clear button</p> -->

                <h5>Styles</h5>
                <p>&middot;Created a
                    <b>Gradient Color</b> of black and deep blue as the background color</p>
                <p>&middot;Set
                    <b>Pure Color</b> aqua as the border color to increase contrast for better vistual effects</p>
                <p>&middot;Imported
                    <b>SVG Image</b> as the image to iconically prompt its functionality</p>

                <h5>Animations</h5>
                <p>&middot;Created CSS Animations such as
                    <b>Key Frames</b> to show and hide images</p>
                <p>&middot;Calculated
                    <b>SVG Path</b> to make the animations for electricity line</p>

                <h5>Contorlls</h5>
                <p>&middot;Implemented
                    <b>onTouch Events</b> to handle contorllings. Players could swipe on screen to play rather than just click
                </p>
                <p>&middot;Attached
                    <b>onClick Listener</b> to functional buttons </p>

                <h5>Map Generator Algorithm</h5>
                <p>&middot;Initiailize a
                    <b>Random</b> point as the start point. Mark this point as visited</p>
                <p>&middot;Use while loops, every turn generate a
                    <b>Random</b> feasible point as the next point until there is no feasible point</p>
                <p>&middot;Move to this point, mark it as visited. Continue Executing while loops</p>
                <p>&middot;If thers is no more feasible point, break while loop and return the result</p>


                <h5>Modified Euler Path Theory</h5>
                <p>&middot;Declare a 2D
                    <b>ArrayList</b> as a
                    <b>Stack</b> to keep track of visited points</p>
                <p>&middot;If a point is visited, push this point to
                    <b>Stack</b>, which is an
                    <b>ArrayList</b>
                </p>

                <h5>Adjacency and Border Detection</h5>
                <p>&middot;Declare a 2D
                    <b>ArrayList</b> to keep track of current grid status</p>
                <p>&middot;If a point's coordinates(i, j) is inside the array's boundary, it is feasible</p>
                <p>&middot;If a point is not in the
                    <b>Stack</b>, it is feasible</p>
                <p>&middot;If a point is not visited, it is feasible</p>
